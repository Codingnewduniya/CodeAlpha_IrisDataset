# CodeAlpha_IrisDataset
##  Project Overview
This project is part of the **CodeAlpha Data Science Internship**.  
The goal is to build a **machine learning model** that classifies Iris flowers into three species:
- Setosa
- Versicolor
- Virginica  

using their sepal and petal measurements.

##  Dataset
- Source: [Iris Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurabh00007/iriscsv)  
- Features: Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, Petal Width  
- Target: Species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)  

---

##  Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- Pandas, Numpy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  

---

## Steps Performed
1. Data loading & preprocessing  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (pairplots, correlations)  
3. Splitting dataset into train-test sets  
4. Model training using Logistic Regression  
5. Model evaluation (accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report)

## ðŸ“ˆ Results
- Achieved **high accuracy** in predicting Iris flower species.  
- Visualizations helped understand the separation between classes.
